# dojo-node

There are basically two ways to use dojo libraries in node

- dojo way: code in dojo amd style, run by node (see <https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate>)
- our way: code in node style, and use dojo modules if you need them, drequire('')

This repo is only landing page for other project:

TODO: packaging is to be defined

- drequire 			(require dojo module from node code)
- dnode 			(only implified runner for amd style node app)
- dnode-build 		(build dojo modules used by your app, do not need all dojo on disk)
